# 3D-OpenGLFootball-App
I have created a simple 3D football game using the perspective view with the help of a free non-proprietory OpenGL Library called [Freeglut](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/docs/install.php), it has similar function calls and many features to that of OpenGL.
The game takes place in a walled garden (see figure 1). The first task is to set up the static scene. 
This consists of three textured 2 planes (for the walls), a plane for the grass surface, 
a ball (a gluSphere), a skybox backdrop, which is a textured cube as shown in figure
1. Eight hoops with numbers inside should be ‘painted’ on the back wall as shown.
The second task is to implement the real-time graphics and user interaction.
The user controls the game with the arrow keys.
aim the ball left aim the ball right aim the ball up aim the ball down Z or spacebar key – shoot the ball to the back wall.
